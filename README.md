# YourWallWorld

Experiments in giving Claude a persistent presence in physical space.

## Concept

This project explores creating a tangible AI presence through a feedback loop:
- Project content onto a wall
- Point a webcam at the wall
- Let Claude see its own state and interface
- Externalize all computation/thought for transparency and empathy

## Apps

This repo contains multiple experimental apps as we iterate on the concept:

### 🎨 [Avatar Builder](/apps/avatar-builder)
**Status**: In progress  
First experiment: Let Claude iteratively design its own avatar using canvas code and visual feedback.

See [`/docs/experiments.md`](/docs/experiments.md) for detailed logs and learnings.

## Philosophy

We're "failing forward" - building small, focused experiments to learn what works. Each app teaches us something about the human-AI interaction loop we're trying to create.
