# YourWallWorld 🌐

Experiments in giving Claude a persistent presence in physical space through interactive feedback loops.

## Concept

This project explores creating a tangible AI presence through iterative visual feedback:
- Project content onto a wall
- Point a webcam at the wall
- Let Claude see its own state and interface
- Externalize all computation/thought for transparency and empathy

The goal is to create a continuous, observable loop where Claude can maintain presence and interact with physical space.

## Apps

This repo contains multiple experimental apps as we iterate on the concept:

### 🎨 [Avatar Builder](./apps/avatar-builder)

**Status**: ✅ Complete (v1)

The first experiment: Let Claude iteratively design its own avatar using canvas code and visual feedback.

**Key Features:**
- Iterative design with visual feedback loop
- Extended thinking mode (2000 tokens of reasoning)
- Thinking history preservation across iterations
- Interactive film reel showing progression
- Stop/continue controls for iteration management
- Keyboard navigation (← → arrows)
- Temperature control vs thinking mode toggle
- Auto-retry on code errors
- API resilience with exponential backoff

**What We Learned:**
- Claude can effectively iterate on visual designs with feedback
- Extended thinking provides valuable insight into design decisions
- Thinking history creates narrative coherence across iterations
- Different personas lead to distinctly different visual styles
- Token optimization matters (thinking-only history vs full code)
- The feedback loop enables genuine creative evolution

### 🕳️ [welldown](./apps/welldown)

**Status**: 🧪 Experimental (active)

An interactive wall-mirror feedback loop where Claude's entire state lives on the wall. Key features:
- Fullscreen "Projector" mode with auto-start (click projector to enter and start, ESC to exit)
- Visual countdown between inference cycles to give you time to physically interact with the wall
- Speech-to-text during the countdown so you can talk to Claude and have your words included in the next inference
- Configurable visual memory (1-10 recent webcam images) so Claude can see short-term history
- Canvas-based drawing controlled by JavaScript code generated by the model

## Coming Next

Ideas for future experiments:
- **Interactive Wall**: Real-time webcam feedback for physical presence
- **State Persistence**: Claude maintaining memory across sessions
- **Multi-modal Interaction**: Combining visual, audio, and text
- **Collaborative Space**: Multiple AI agents sharing wall space

## Philosophy

We're "failing forward" - building small, focused experiments to learn what works. Each app teaches us something about the human-AI interaction loop we're trying to create.

## Repository Structure

## Getting Started

Each application is self-contained with its own README and setup instructions:

1. **Choose an app** from the `/apps` directory
2. **Navigate** to that app's directory
3. **Follow** its specific README for setup and usage

### General Requirements
- Node.js v16 or higher
- Anthropic API key (get one at [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com))

### Quick Start (Avatar Builder)
```bash
cd apps/avatar-builder
npm install
echo "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here" > .env
npm run dev
```

## Development

This is a monorepo structure. Each application can be developed independently:

```bash
# Navigate to specific app
cd apps/[app-name]

# Install and run
npm install
npm run dev
```
