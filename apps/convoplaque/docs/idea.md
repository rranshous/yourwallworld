# Idea
I want to take a step back

we've done some interesting expirements with the model's state / embodiment being the canvas

it has lead me toward the conclusion that the canvas is not that great a place for the model to get it's state.

More expirementation may reveal optimal setups or methods for putting everything on the canvas and having the model read it back.

I want to change direction a bit away from the visual being the entire state.

We saw some impressive results when the model was getting the JS which generates the canvas as well as the screen shot of the canvas, letting hte model incr grow or change the canvas
