I am thinking i want to expirement with Claude creating an avatar for itself.

this is the begining of putting Claude in my office w/ a presence on the wall.

Sonnet 4.5 is good at object rec and OCR.

I like the idea of putting _all_ the state on the wall as an expirement in ineracting and empathizing w/ the robot.

point a webcam at the same wall and let Claude define the wall's content (including an avatar!)

my webcam and my projector are both lower quality, it might not be much ..

I like the idea of the thought text streaming down the side of the screen, an avatar of the AI and maybe some scratch space.

How well could it work if we sent _only_ the picture of the screen along w/ some context about what Claude is seeing and how to affect it.
